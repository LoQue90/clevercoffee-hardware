# CleverCoffee Hardware 

<br>

KiCAD projects for breakout boards based on the ESP32 DevKitC v4 

* Full-featured PCB with support for pressure and flow sensors, rotary encoder 
* Minimal PCB with a smaller footprint and all unused GPIO-Pins on a separate header

<br>
If you want to order PCBs yourself please keep in mind that the larger board is still a work in progress and should be regarded as a development platform. The pinmapping for the features that are not yet on the minimal PCB is subject to change at any time.
<br>
<br>
For the latest revision of the minimal PCB just write us a message on our Discord.
<br>
<br>
If you want to create your own hardware based on our designs, please contact us beforehand to make sure you're not developing against an outdated revision. There may be unpublished changes not yet available in the repository.<br>
Also note that for regulatory and safety reasons we are not interested in designs with components operating at mains voltage.
